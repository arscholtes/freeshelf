Activity: Freeshelf, Day 1

Work on day 1 of the Freeshelf project. Have a check-in with a partner and with an instructor on your progress. The instructions for day 1 are repeated below.

During this project, you will build a Ruby on Rails application to collect an index of free programming books online. This application will, after three days, allow users to look at the index, add new books, edit books they added, and remove books.

On the first day, your application should:

Allow anyone to create a new book entry
Books have, at a minimum, a title, author, description, and URL
Allow anyone to update or delete a book entry
Allow anyone to view the list of books

Added features:

If you finish all of the above, consider some of the following-->

Style your application with your own CSS by editing app/assets/stylesheets/application.css or digging into the asset pipeline
Paginate the list of books with Kaminari
Your role as a student

Articulate their ideas as best you can. Try to facilitate effective collaboration with your paired student. Be willing to debate strategies for how best to approach your challenge, but donâ€™t allow endless debate to keep you from making progress. Keep your eye on the clock and try to work yourself through the challenge at a reasonable pace. You and your partner should share the responsibility for authoring ideas and code. Finish your challenge and make certain that you call talk someone through the logic and strategies implemented by your group.
